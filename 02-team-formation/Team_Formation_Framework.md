# Team Formation Framework

**Tech4Life & Beyond LLC**  
**Applies to:** All approved concepts entering structured development

---

## 1. Purpose

This framework defines how a Product Cell is formed after a concept passes the Concept Definition Gate.

Team formation ensures:
- Structural clarity
- Role definition
- Ethical oversight
- Contribution traceability

No product advances without an assigned Product Cell.

---

## 2. Activation Trigger

Team Formation begins when:

- A concept is officially approved
- A Temporary Concept ID is assigned
- Governance confirms advancement to development

---

## 3. Product Cell Structure

Each Product Cell must include:

### 3.1 Architect (1 required)
- Facilitates coordination
- Ensures documentation integrity
- Guides ethical compliance
- Does not act as authoritarian leader

### 3.2 Creator (Minimum 1)
- Leads technical or structural development
- Owns design architecture
- Documents core decisions

### 3.3 Contributors (Flexible number)
- Provide support across research, testing, documentation, validation, modeling
- Work within defined scopes

### 3.4 Ethics Reviewer (Required for complex or high-impact products)
- Independent perspective when possible
- Reviews risk and unintended consequences
- May be rotating or external to the core cell

Observers are unlimited but have no write authority.

---

## 4. Ideal Team Size Guidelines

For Simple Products:
- 1 Architect
- 1 Creator
- 1–3 Contributors

For Complex Products (hardware + AI + compliance):
- 1 Architect
- 2–3 Creators
- 3–6 Contributors
- 1 Independent Ethics Reviewer

Cells exceeding 9 active members must consider subdivision.

---

## 5. Role Assignment Principles

Roles are assigned based on:
- Skill relevance
- Documented competence
- Reputation score
- Availability

Role assignment must be documented at formation.

---

## 6. Entry & Exit Rules

Members may:
- Join with documented approval
- Exit voluntarily with notice
- Remain credited for completed contributions

No contributor may remove documented work upon exit.

---

## 7. Contribution Agreement

Before active development, all members must:
- Accept TOIL principles
- Acknowledge royalty-based compensation structure
- Confirm understanding of non-salary participation

---

## 8. Governance Link

Product Cells operate autonomously within defined scope.

Escalation to Governance occurs only if:
- Ethical violations emerge
- Conflict cannot be resolved internally
- Strategic misalignment appears

---

## 9. Documentation Requirement

Each Product Cell must create:
- Team Roster Document
- Contribution Log File
- Version-Control Reference

If a team is not documented, it does not formally exist.

---

## 10. Structural Principle

Small teams move faster.

Clarity beats size.

Horizontal leadership does not eliminate responsibility.
