# Concept Definition Framework

**Tech4Life & Beyond LLC**  
**Applies to:** All new product ideas entering the Tech4Life ecosystem

---

## 1. Purpose

This framework defines how an idea becomes a structured product concept inside Tech4Life.

No idea advances to team formation without passing this stage.

Concept Definition transforms:

Idea → Structured Opportunity

---

## 2. Entry Trigger

A concept begins when:

- A contributor submits an idea
- An Architect proposes a strategic initiative
- A Product Cell identifies a new derivative opportunity

All ideas must be documented using the official Concept Template.

---

## 3. Required Concept Components

Every concept must clearly define:

### 3.1 Problem Statement
- What real-world problem exists?
- Who is affected?
- Why does current market fail to solve it adequately?

If the problem is unclear, the idea pauses.

---

### 3.2 Proposed Solution
- What is the core innovation?
- Is it mechanical, digital, systemic, or hybrid?
- What differentiates it?

This stage does not require engineering detail.

---

### 3.3 Beneficiary Analysis
- Who benefits?
- Does it prevent harm or create new dependency?
- Does it align with Tech4Life mission?

---

### 3.4 Ethical Pre-Screen
- Could this be misused?
- Could it cause environmental harm?
- Could it create social manipulation?

If ethical risk is high, escalation occurs before advancement.

---

### 3.5 Feasibility Snapshot
- Is the technology achievable with current tools?
- Is it realistically manufacturable?
- Is it economically viable under a royalty model?

This is preliminary, not final validation.

---

## 4. Classification of Concepts

Concepts are classified as:

- Category A — Hardware Product
- Category B — Software / AI System
- Category C — Hybrid System
- Category D — Methodology / Framework

Classification determines next pipeline steps.

---

## 5. Decision Gate

After documentation, the concept enters review:

1. Ethical pre-review
2. Governance alignment check
3. Preliminary technical viability discussion

Possible outcomes:

- Approved for Team Formation
- Sent back for refinement
- Rejected with documentation

All outcomes must be logged.

---

## 6. Documentation Rule

If it is not written in the Concept Definition file, it does not exist.

All approved concepts receive:
- Temporary Concept ID
- Timestamp
- Assigned Architect (if advanced)

---

## 7. Integrity Safeguard

No concept may skip directly to design or prototyping.

Skipping Concept Definition undermines traceability and TOIL protection.

---

## 8. Strategic Principle

Tech4Life does not chase trends.

It builds:
- Preventative technologies
- Life-enhancing systems
- Ethically durable innovations

Speed without clarity is rejected.
