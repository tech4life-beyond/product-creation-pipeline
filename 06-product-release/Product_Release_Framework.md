# Product Release Framework

**Tech4Life & Beyond LLC**  
**Applies to:** All products completing Validation and entering official publication or licensing stage

---

## 1. Purpose

This framework defines when and how a product is officially released within Tech4Life.

Release is not marketing.
Release is not prototyping.
Release is the formal transition from internal development to structured external visibility.

---

## 2. Release Types

A product may be released under one of the following categories:

### 2.1 Public Concept Release
- Concept validated
- No prototype required
- TOIL Registration completed
- Suitable for early licensing discussions

### 2.2 Prototype-Based Release
- Physical or functional prototype documented
- Validation Report completed
- Manufacturing feasibility snapshot available

### 2.3 Licensing-Ready Release
- TDD finalized
- Validation Approved
- Sell Sheet completed
- Pitch Deck completed
- Royalty Agreement template prepared

Each release type must be explicitly declared.

---

## 3. Required Documentation Before Release

Before any release, the following must exist:

- Concept Definition File
- Team Formation Record
- TDD (Technical Design Document)
- Validation Summary Report
- Ethics Statement
- TOIL Registration Record

If any required document is missing, release is blocked.

---

## 4. TOIL Registration Requirement

No product may be released without:

- Assigned TOIL Product ID
- Timestamped Registration Record
- License version reference

TOIL registration establishes traceability and prior art positioning.

---

## 5. Public vs Internal Release

### Public Release Includes:
- Sell Sheet
- Pitch Deck (if applicable)
- TOIL short license notice
- Contributor credits

### Internal-Only Documents:
- Detailed TDD
- Contribution logs
- Internal cost models
- Governance notes

Sensitive documents remain private unless strategic disclosure is required.

---

## 6. Release Authority

Release requires:

- Architect confirmation
- Ethical sign-off
- Governance acknowledgment (for complex products)

No single individual may unilaterally release a product.

---

## 7. Post-Release Monitoring

After release, the Product Cell must:

- Monitor licensing inquiries
- Track community feedback
- Log derivative proposals
- Document version updates

Release does not end responsibility.

---

## 8. Version Control

Each released product must declare:

- Release Version (e.g., v1.0)
- Release Type
- Release Date

Subsequent updates require new version declaration.

---

## 9. Integrity Rule

A product cannot be marketed beyond its release classification.

Misrepresentation of readiness status is prohibited.
