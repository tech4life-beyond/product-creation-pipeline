# Design Frameworks

**Tech4Life & Beyond LLC**  
**Applies to:** All products developed within the Tech4Life ecosystem

---

## 1. Purpose

This framework defines how products are designed inside Tech4Life.

Design must be:
- Modular
- Documented
- Ethical
- Scalable
- Manufacturing-aware

No product proceeds without structured design documentation.

---

## 2. Technical Design Document (TDD)

A **Technical Design Document (TDD)** is the primary engineering document for any product.

It contains:

### 2.1 System Overview
- Mission of the product
- Architecture diagram
- Functional blocks

### 2.2 Hardware Design (if applicable)
- Mechanical structure
- Materials
- Power system
- Sensors and actuators
- PCB architecture (if applicable)

### 2.3 Software / Firmware Design (if applicable)
- System logic
- Data flow
- Edge processing
- Communication layers

### 2.4 AI Integration (if applicable)
- Model type
- Training source
- Edge vs cloud decisions
- Ethical guardrails

### 2.5 Risk & Constraint Analysis
- Mechanical constraints
- Environmental factors
- Regulatory considerations

The TDD evolves through versions and remains under version control.

---

## 3. Universal Product Template (UPT)

All hardware or hybrid products must be mapped to the Tech4Life Universal Product Template:

1. Energy Module
2. Processing Module
3. Communication Module
4. Sensing Module
5. Actuation Module
6. Mechanical Shell
7. Firmware Stack
8. Cloud / AI Layer
9. Ethics Policy
10. TOIL License

This modular mapping ensures interoperability and traceability.

---

## 4. Design Principles

### 4.1 Modularity
Products should be divisible into independent blocks.

### 4.2 Maintainability
Products must allow inspection, repair, or component replacement when possible.

### 4.3 Ethical Constraint
Design must minimize harm and prevent misuse.

### 4.4 Documentation First
No design is considered valid without written documentation.

---

## 5. Design Review Stages

1. Conceptual Design Review
2. Architectural Review
3. Feasibility Check
4. Ethical Review
5. Pre-Prototype Freeze

Design Freeze must be documented before prototyping.

---

## 6. Traceability Requirement

Each design iteration must:
- Reference Concept ID
- Reference Product Cell
- Be timestamped
- Link to contribution logs

Traceability protects TOIL integrity.

---

## 7. Design Integrity Rule

If it is not written in the TDD, it is not part of the product.
