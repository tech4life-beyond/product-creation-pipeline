# Prototype Status Framework

**Tech4Life & Beyond LLC**  
**Applies to:** All Tech4Life products governed under TOIL

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **how prototype status is classified, documented, and communicated** within Tech4Life & Beyond LLC.

Its purpose is to:
- Avoid false or misleading claims
- Standardize expectations with manufacturers and partners
- Establish a repeatable process across all products
- Separate *concept validation* from *physical prototyping*

Tech4Life does **not** fabricate or simulate prototypes that do not exist.

---

## 2. Prototype Philosophy

Within Tech4Life, a prototype is:

> A physical or functional representation of a product used to validate form, function, manufacturability, or integration.

Key principles:
- Prototypes are **evidence-based**, not conceptual claims
- A product may be licensable **before** a prototype exists
- Prototype creation is driven by licensing interest or manufacturing partnership
- Ethical transparency overrides commercial pressure

---

## 3. Prototype Status Levels

Each product is assigned **one and only one** Prototype Status at any given time.

### Level 0 — Concept Validated
- No physical prototype exists
- Functional concept defined
- Use case and problem clearly validated
- Design intent documented

**Permitted claims:**
- Concept validated
- Design defined
- Licensing discussion allowed

---

### Level 1 — Early Physical Prototype
- First physical or functional prototype exists
- May be non-production materials
- Used for basic validation

**Permitted claims:**
- Physical prototype exists
- Functional testing in progress

---

### Level 2 — Functional Prototype
- Prototype validates intended function
- Representative of final behavior
- Used for field or lab testing

**Permitted claims:**
- Functional prototype validated
- Ready for manufacturer evaluation

---

### Level 3 — Manufacturing Prototype
- Prototype reflects manufacturing constraints
- Material and process aligned
- Suitable for pilot production

**Permitted claims:**
- Manufacturing-ready prototype
- Licensing execution phase

---

## 4. Activation Triggers for Prototyping

Prototype development may be initiated when one or more of the following occur:
- Manufacturer expresses formal licensing interest
- Manufacturing partner offers prototyping support
- Strategic need is approved by Product Governance

Tech4Life does not self-fund prototypes unless explicitly approved.

---

## 5. Responsibility & Cost Allocation

- Prototype costs are defined **before** fabrication
- Costs may be covered by:
  - Manufacturing partner
  - Licensing advance
  - Joint development agreement

All arrangements must be documented.

---

## 6. Documentation Requirements

When a prototype exists, documentation must include:
- Prototype level
- Date created
- Purpose of prototype
- Visual evidence (photos, diagrams)
- Testing notes (if applicable)

No prototype may be referenced without documentation.

---

## 7. Relationship to Licensing & TOIL

- Prototype status does not alter TOIL ownership or ethics
- Licensing terms must reflect actual prototype maturity
- No prototype status may contradict TOIL Registration Records

---

## 8. Review & Updates

This framework:
- Applies to all current and future products
- Is reviewed periodically
- May evolve, but cannot weaken transparency requirements
